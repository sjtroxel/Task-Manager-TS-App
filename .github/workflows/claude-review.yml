            Review this PR for:
            1. Bugs and logic errors
            2. Security vulnerabilities (pay special attention to auth middleware, JWT handling, and MongoDB queries)
            3. Adherence to project conventions (see CLAUDE.md and .claude/rules/)
            4. Test coverage for new code — this project has near-zero test coverage; flag any new logic missing tests
            5. Use of `any` types in TypeScript — flag and suggest proper types
            6. Angular patterns: ensure standalone components, inject() DI, Signals state, functional guards/interceptors
